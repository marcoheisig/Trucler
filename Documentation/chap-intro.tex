In section 8.5 of the second edition of the book ``Common Lisp, the
Language'' by Guy Steele \cite{Steele:1990:CLL:95411}, a protocol for
accessing compile-time environments is defined.  That protocol has
two main problems:

\begin{enumerate}
\item It is incomplete.  It does not provide for a way to query the
  invironment for information about blocks or tags.
\item It is not extensible.  In order for an implementation to make
  one of the query functions return more information, additional
  return values would have to be defined.  However, such a change is
  not considered backward compatible, so this kind of extension is not
  recommended.
\end{enumerate}

\sysname{} introduces a protocol that solves these problems as
follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item It contains additional query and augmentation functions for
  blocks and tags.
\item Instead of returning multiple values, the query functions return
  standard instances.  Accessors specialized to the classes of those
  instances provide the information that the protocol in the book
  provides as multiple values.
\end{enumerate}

In addition to providing a mechanism that solves the problems of
protocol presented in the book, we also add several new features that
a compiler must use to process source code.
