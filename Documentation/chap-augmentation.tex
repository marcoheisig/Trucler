\chapter{Augmenting the environment}

\section{Creating new information instances}

In order to create a new information instance, \texttt{make-instance}
must be called, providing values for all the initialization arguments
corresponding to features that do not have any initialization forms.

\section{Low-level augmentation functions}

In this section, we describe basic functions for augmenting an
environment, given an old environment and an information instance.

\Defgeneric {augment-with-variable-information}\\
            {client environment variable-information}

This function is used to create a new environment object from an
existing environment object and an instance of the class
\texttt{variable-information}.

\Defmethod {augment-with-variable-information}\\
           {client\\
            (environment {\tt environment})\\
            (variable-information {\tt variable-information})}

This default method returns a new environment object which is like the
one passed as an argument, except that \textit{variable-information}
will shadow any variable information with the same name.

\Defgeneric {augment-with-function-information}\\
            {client environment function-information}

This function is used to create a new environment object from an
existing environment object and an instance of the class
\texttt{function-information}.

\Defmethod {augment-with-function-information}\\
           {client\\
            (environment {\tt environment})\\
            (function-information {\tt function-information})}

This default method returns a new environment object which is like the
one passed as an argument, except that \textit{function-information}
will shadow any function information with the same name.

\Defgeneric {augment-with-block-information}\\
            {client environment block-information}

This function is used to create a new environment object from an
existing environment object and an instance of the class
\texttt{block-information}.

\Defmethod {augment-with-block-information}\\
           {client\\
            (environment {\tt environment})\\
            (block-information {\tt block-information})}

This default method returns a new environment object which is like the
one passed as an argument, except that \textit{block-information}
will shadow any block information with the same name.

\Defgeneric {augment-with-tag-information}\\
            {client environment tag-information}

This function is used to create a new environment object from an
existing environment object and an instance of the class
\texttt{tag-information}.

\Defmethod {augment-with-tag-information}\\
           {client\\
            (environment {\tt environment})\\
            (tag-information {\tt tag-information})}

This default method returns a new environment object which is like the
one passed as an argument, except that \textit{tag-information}
will shadow any tag information with the same name.

\Defgeneric {augment-with-optimize-information}\\
            {client environment optimize-information}

This function is used to create a new environment object from an
existing environment object and an instance of the class
\texttt{optimize-information}.

\Defmethod {augment-with-optimize-information}\\
           {client\\
            (environment {\tt environment})\\
            (optimize-information {\tt optimize-information})}

This default method returns a new environment object which is like the
one passed as an argument, except that \textit{optimize-information}
will shadow any previous optimize information.

\section{Adding and annotating variables}

\subsection{Adding a lexical variable}

{\footnotesize
\Defgeneric {add-lexical-variable} {client environment name \optional identity}
}

This function returns a new environment that is like
\textit{environment} except that it has been augumented with a lexical
variable named \textit{name}.  The optional argument \textit{identity}
can be supplied by client code to distinguish different lexical
variables with the same name.

\subsection{Adding a special variable}

{\footnotesize
\Defgeneric {add-special-variable} {client environment name}
}

This function returns a new environment that is like
\textit{environment} except that it has been augumented with a special
variable named \textit{name}.

\subsection{Annotating a variable with a type}
\label{sec-annotating-a-variable-with-a-type}

{\footnotesize
\Defgeneric {add-variable-type} {client environment name type}
}

This function returns a new environment that is like
\textit{environment} except that the variable named \textit{name} has
been annotated with the type specifier \textit{type}.

The type of the variable returned when the new environment is queried
for the variable named \textit{name} will have a new type that is the
conjunction of \textit{type} and the type it had in
\textit{environment}.

This function can be used when \textit{name} names a lexical variable,
a special variable, or a symbol macro
\seesec{sec-annotating-a-symbol-macro-with-a-type}, but \emph{not}
when \textit{name} names a constant variable.

\subsection{Annotating a variable with an \texttt{ignore} declaration}
\label{sec-annotating-a-variable-with-ignore}

{\footnotesize
\Defgeneric {add-variable-ignore} {client environment name ignore}
}

This function returns a new environment that is like
\textit{environment} except that the variable named \textit{name} has
been annotated with an \texttt{ignore} declaration.

The argument \textit{ignore} must be the symbol \texttt{ignore} or the
symbol \texttt{ignorable}.

This function can be used when \textit{name} names a lexical variable
or a local symbol macro
\seesec{sec-annotating-a-local-symbol-macro-with-ignore}.

\section{Adding and annotating symbol macros}

\subsection{Adding a local symbol macro}

{\footnotesize
\Defgeneric {add-local-symbol-macro} {client environment name expansion}
}

This function returns a new environment that is like
\textit{environment} except that it has been augmented with a local
symbol macro named \texttt{name}, with the expansion
\textit{expansion}

\subsection{Annotating a symbol macro with a type}
\label{sec-annotating-a-symbol-macro-with-a-type}

The generic function \texttt{add-variable-type}
\seesec{sec-annotating-a-variable-with-a-type} can be used to annotate
the type of a (local or global) symbol macro.

\subsection{Annotating a symbol macro with an \texttt{ignore} declaration}
\label{sec-annotating-a-local-symbol-macro-with-ignore}

The generic function \texttt{add-variable-ignore}
\seesec{sec-annotating-a-variable-with-ignore} can be used to annotate
a \emph{local} symbol macro with an \texttt{ignore} declaration.
Global symbol macros can not be annotated this way.

\section{Adding and annotating functions}

\subsection{Adding a local function}

{\footnotesize
\Defgeneric {add-local-function} {client environment name \optional identity}
}

This function returns a new environment that is like
\textit{environment} except that it has been augumented with a local
function named \textit{name}.  The optional argument \textit{identity}
can be supplied by client code to distinguish different functions with
the same name.

\section{Adding and annotating macros}

{\footnotesize
\Defgeneric {add-local-macro} {client environment name expander}
}

This function returns a new environment that is like
\textit{environment} except that it has been augmented with a local
macro named \texttt{name}.  The argument \textit{expander} is a
macro-expansion function that takes two arguments, a form and an
environment.

\section{Adding a block}

{\footnotesize
\Defgeneric {add-block} {client environment name \optional identity}
}

This function returns a new environment that is like
\textit{environment} except that it has been augumented with a block
named \textit{name}, which must be a symbol.  The optional argument
\textit{identity} can be supplied by client code to distinguish
different blocks with the same name.

\section{Adding a tag}

{\footnotesize
\Defgeneric {add-tag} {client environment tag \optional identity}
}

This function returns a new environment that is like
\textit{environment} except that it has been augumented with a tag
named \textit{tag}, which must be a \emph{go tag}, i.e. a symbol or an
integer.  The optional argument \textit{identity} can be supplied by
client code to distinguish different tags with the same name.
