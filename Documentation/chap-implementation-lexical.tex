\chapter{Customizing with existing lexical environments}

A typical existing \commonlisp{} implementation has its own
representation of lexical environments and no explicit representation
of the global environment.  In this chapter, we describe the kind of
customization that such an implementation needs to provide in order to
use \sysname{}.

\section{Representing the global environment}

Despite the fact that a typical existing implementation has no
first-class object representing the global environment, in order to
customize \sysname{}, the implementation should nevertheless define a
standard class representing such a hypothetical first-class
environment.  In instance of this environment object must be passed to
the language processor, so that when the language processor queries
the null lexical environment for some information, this instance is
passed to the query functions.
