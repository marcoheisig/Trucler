\chapter{Querying the environment}

\label{chap-environment-querying}

In this chapter, we describe classes and functions that are used by
the compiler to query the environment concerning information about
program elements that the compiler needs in order to determine how to
process those program elements. 

When the compiler calls a generic query function, it passes the
environment as the first argument.  Client code must supply methods
on these functions, specialized to its particular representation of
environments. 

These methods should return instances of the classes described in this
chapter.  Any such instance contains all available information about
some program element in that particular environment.  This information
must typically be assembled from different parts of the environment.
For that reason, client code typically creates a new instance whenever
a query function is called, rather than attempting to store such
instances in the environment.  If any of these client-supplied methods
fails to accomplish its task, it should return \texttt{nil}.

Client code is free to define subclasses of the classes described
here, for instance in order to represent implementation-specific
information about the program elements.  Client code would then
typically also provide auxiliary methods or overriding primary methods
on the compilation functions that handle these classes.

\section{Variable information}

\Defgeneric {variable-info} {environment symbol}

This function is called by the compiler whenever a symbol in a
\emph{variable} position is to be compiled.  If successful, it returns an instance of
one of the classes described below.

This condition is signaled by \sysname{} when a client-supplied method
